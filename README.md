# Porthmadog Tide Times

The fourth iteration of this site is a React app, compiled to a static site using Gatsby. Styling framework is Mantine. 

## Development

### VSCode

Two containers are provided - one is a Gatsby container and the other is a PHP container. The Gatsby container is used to run the Gatsby development server and the PHP container is used to run the PHP script that generates the json tidal data and which generates the PDFs. A VSCode task is provided for running the build script. 

#### Connect to both containers in two VS Code windows

1. Open a VS Code window at the root level of the project.
1. Run Dev Containers: Reopen in Container from the Command Palette (F1) and select `Gatsby Container`.
1. VS Code will then start up both containers, reload the current window and connect to the selected container.
1. Next, open a new window using File > New Window.
1. Open your project at root level in the current window.
1. Run Dev Containers: Reopen in Container from the Command Palette (F1) and select `PHP Container`.
1. The current VS Code window will reload and connect to the selected container.
1. You can now interact with both containers from separate windows.

#### Connect to multiple containers in a single VS Code window

1. Open a VS Code window at the root level of the project.
1. Run Dev Containers: Reopen in Container from the Command Palette (F1) and select `Gatsby Container`.
1. VS Code will then start up both containers, reload the current window and connect to the selected container.
1. Run Dev Containers: Switch Container from the Command Palette (F1) and select `PHP Container`.
1. The current VS Code window will reload and connect to the selected container.
1. You can switch back with the same command
